# ThunderEngine
A Project between 3 guys and a horse.

## Getting Started
To get started with using the engine, you have to clone the project with the --recursive.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/blackout1471/ThunderEngine.git
```
The --recursive part is important to fetch all the submodules, which is needed to build the project.

After the project has been cloned, you can go ahead and double click the file Generate_solutions.bat to generate the project for your OS.
